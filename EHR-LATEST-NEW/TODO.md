# TODO: Implement Automatic Logout on Browser Close and Inactivity

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Define session timeout constant in header.php (e.g., 30 minutes)
- [x] Add last_activity timestamp update in header.php on each page load
- [x] Add session expiration check in header.php: if expired, destroy session and redirect to login
- [x] Update logout.php to handle timeout-based logouts (e.g., clear session_id and log timeout event)
- [x] Update index.php to display timeout message when redirected
- [x] Test the timeout by simulating inactivity and checking automatic logout
- [x] Verify that sudden browser close logs out due to session cookies and beacon
